            <p>Why Do Great Work</p>

            <p>I like writing in questions and answers because that's how I usually think and writing is just my thinking.</p>

            <p>I also like starting with asking why, whenever it makes sense, because it sets the sense right off the bat. Like why am I even doing this? I find the sense in things this way.</p>

            <p>So why do great work?</p>

            <p>I can answer with another question like "why not," but the generation today has popularized the concept of "bare minimum," and although it's being used in multiple ways, most people use it to go on with their days with just bare minimum. They say people who do bare minimum at work are the happiest. Clock in at 9am, clock out at 5pm. Get paid every 15th and 30th. Go on vacations 10x a year. Get by in between. 8 hours for work. 8 hours for yourself. 8 hours for sleep. Bare minimum makes sense. For some.</p>

            <p>Can you do great work with bare minimum (general term for quality)?I think no, with certainty.</p>

            <p>But can you do great work with bare minimum hours (quantity)? Debatable, but I think yes it's possible.</p>

            <p>I've probably strayed away from the question, that's how I am whenever I lose sight and sense of things. That is why answering the "why" of everything you do is important.</p>

            <p>So to circle back on the question:</p>

            <p>1. It feels good. Doing great work feels genuinely good for your soul.</p>

            <p>2. It's paying forward. You owe it to the past generations who inspired you in one way or another. Work is the currency you pay for. We are all surrounded by potential energy.</p>

            <p>3. It's achieving our truest nature and form. All who do great work are artists. Our lives become our work of art. We are all creatives (potential artists), but only those who do great work and push creativity to better their work of art (ie. their life) are the artists. The refusal to be creative* is self-will and is counter to our true nature.</p>

            <p>4. It's spiritual (if you're spiritual). Our creative dreams and yearnings come from a divine source. As we move toward our dreams, we move toward our divinity.</p>

            <p>5. [ask founders: how does it feel to do great work?]</p>

            <p class="footnote">* creative is synonymous to "doer of great work"</p>

            <p>Can you be lazy and ambitious?</p>
